#### «Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.»

A quotation I really like because it's to the point of how I think about and how I try to do my work. And... who said it? Yes, God almighty, Mr. Steve Jobs, 2003. I've also found some others I like:   

#### «The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.»

[Hans Hofmann](http://www.hanshofmann.org/)   

#### «The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.»

[Bertrand Russell](http://www.writersmugs.com/quote/Bertrand_Russell/26.html)   

#### «A picture is worth a thousand words. An interface is worth a thousand pictures.»

[Ben Shneiderman, 2003](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/)   

#### «I’ve been amazed at how often those outside the discipline of design assume that what designers do is decoration. Good design is problem solving.»

[Jeffery Veen, 2000](http://www.veen.com/artsci/)   

#### «Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity.»

[Charles Mingus](http://www.mingusmingusmingus.com/bio/mingusbio.html)   

#### «Form follows function-that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.»

[Frank Lloyd Wright](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/369)   

#### «The details are not the details. They make the design.»

[Charles Eames](http://www.eamesoffice.com/)   The following one is a good one for many of my customers ;-)   

#### «A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.»

[Antoine De Saint-Exupery](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?274)   And another one from the almighty – I may not agree 100%, but it's certainly a funny one:   

#### «It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.»

[Steve Jobs, 1998](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/0,70512-0.html)
