GridFitType has a great impact on Text rendering: 

 

<object data="/uploads/flash/GridFitType/GridFitType.swf"></object>



Well not really much to say here: 

  * **NONE** Good for animation and people who prefer Font appearance over readability
  * **SUBPIXEL** Good compromise between readability (small sizes) and appearance
  * **PIXEL** Pure nonsense if you ask me
What I really wonder though is: **Why on earth can't I adjust fractioned text sizes** (aka float)??? In the IDE, yes you can. By actionscript, no you can't. I don't get it.. anybody knows why that is? And more importantly: is there some fancy workaround? (in the example I'm just scaling the text fields, but that's not really a cool solution).
