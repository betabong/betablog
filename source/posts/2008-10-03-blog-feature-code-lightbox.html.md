Just added a little javascript magic: now you can «zoom into» the code snippets in this blog. The javascript is not very -ehm- reusable because it contains some dirty hard coded style stuff, but hey, it does its job pretty well ;-) (btw: not tested on IE). So now time to go to Marc's birthday party. I wish [Marc](http://www.entropy.ch), my favorite code (and soon typo) guru and a good friend, all the best: Rock on!! :-)
