/uploads/2008/10/edelflash_logo.png) [Edel*flash](http://edelflash.ch), a swiss site dedicated to swiss flash excellence, got redesigned as a wordpress blog. I think it's a real nice and wise update. Well done, Simurai! On a side note, first award in v2 is Hugman, designed and concepted by my friend Tobi (also well done!)
