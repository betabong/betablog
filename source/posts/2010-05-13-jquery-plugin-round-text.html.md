My very first jQuery plugin: warps the text along a circle. It's simple and certainly far from perfect â€“ I needed it, so may be you'll need it too :-) 

### Usage:
    
    
    $(elem).roundtext( {radius:150} );

Tested on latest Opera, Safari, Chrome and Firefox (I assume it won't work in bloody IE) 

### Download:

[jquery.roundtext.js](/showcase/jquery-roundtext/jquery.roundtext.js)

### Example:

I used this function here: [www.retro-fanshirt.com](http://www.retro-fanshirt.com) (Turn off plugins to see html version) Sometimes I can see strange behaviour with Safari when it wouldn't consider space characters. Just so you know.
