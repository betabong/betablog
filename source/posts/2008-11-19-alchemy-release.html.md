Adobe today released [Alchemy](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/), a SDK to compile C/C++ code into AVM2 Bytecode. This has been sneak peaked a while ago (see Video below) - now it's here. And I'm amazed!! Think of the possiblities: XSLT interpreter (as demoed in the vid), 3D speed, super fast parsing, physics, AI - everything that's CPU intensive and won't need any platform specific stuff. So far this C code still looks pretty fucked up to me (see examples at the labs), but hell, I'm sure that one day we're gonna see some real fancy stuff thanks to this. I'm looking forward!
