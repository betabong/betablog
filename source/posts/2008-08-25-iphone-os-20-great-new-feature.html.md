![](/uploads/2008/08/ipod-doubleclick.jpg)Today I stumbled across a cool feature in the new iPhone software. What makes it even cooler is the fact that I invented it myself â€“ God aka Mr. Jobs has just listened! So what's the deal? When you press the headset button twice while listening to music, it will skip to the next song. That's it. Isn't that just awesome?! I think so :-)
