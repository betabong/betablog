* [Atelier David Smith](http://atelier.ie/)

A simple but beautifully executed idea. You can resize, navigate by keyboard .. many details I like. Only thing: no mouse wheel support and not too nice aliased font in content section.

  * [David Arias - Portfolio](http://www.arias.ca/)

It's refreshing to see something so clean and simple, yet pretty. No effects, no animation. Clean and slick.
