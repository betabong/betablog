![](/uploads/2008/09/20080919-img_87991.jpg) 15 years ago Markus and Daniel Freitag created their first Freitag bag, made of used truck tarpaulins and some other recycled stuff. So today's the big party, and I'll be there of course. The party will be public starting from 11 pm @ F-abric in the Maag Areal (Zurich, of course). I sure will already be in quite a good shape at that time ;-) Give me a hoorraaaa!! ![](/uploads/2008/09/20080919-img_8803-300x300.jpg)![](/uploads/2008/09/20080919-img_87981-300x300.jpg) **Update:** [Party-Pics here](http://www.freitag.ch/shop/FREITAG/page/news_content_page/detail.jsf)
