When I first saw – years ago – a pic of this [concept car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Microbus_Concept), I thought yeah, that may be the right direction, intelligent design with a subtle retro touch (just linking to its [successful history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Microbus), I'd say). But they've never actually built it. And I wonder why.. ![](/uploads/2008/12/2001-vw-microbus-concept-side-1280x960.jpg) ![](http://blog.betabong.compost_type: post
