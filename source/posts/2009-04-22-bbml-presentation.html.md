Yesterday I had a presentation at the [SFUG meeting](http://www.sfug.ch/?p=123) covering some bits of my rewritten BBML framework (originated from the project laax.com). I've tried to share some insights into the technical concept and strategies for CSS parsing, [CSS selectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_selector) and layout validation.

It's been surprisingly fun (I give credits to the beer sponsored by [Nemos](http://www.nemos.ch/)). People even managed to pretend they'd be interested in what I was prosing, so credit to them too!

So here we go with the presentation:<br>

### FATL

 I'd also like to mention that there'll be **the** swiss flash event soon: Flash at the Lake will not only pamper you with appearances of [great national and international Flash enthustiacs](http://fatl.ch/?page_id=16), it will also give anybody attending the pleasure to enjoy one of Zurich's greatest locations with people who don't think of you as a storm lightning adorer when you sit in the sun twittering Flash into the clear lake. And all that to a fantastic price. Check it out at [fatl.ch](http://fatl.ch)
