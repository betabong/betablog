Yesterday I had a presentation at the [SFUG meeting](http://www.sfug.ch/?p=123) covering some bits of my rewritten BBML framework (originated from the project laax.com). I've tried to share some insights into the technical concept and strategies for CSS parsing, [CSS selectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_selector) and layout validation. ![Sev presenting...](post_type: post

People even managed to pretend they'd be interested in what I was prosing, so credit to them too! ![Flash at the lake Swiss Flash User Group Conference.](http://fatl.ch/banners/fatl_button3_120x60.gif) I'd also like to mention that there'll be **the** swiss flash event soon: Flash at the Lake will not only pamper you with appearances of [great national and international Flash enthustiacs](http://fatl.ch/?page_id=16), it will also give anybody attending the pleasure to enjoy one of Zurich's greatest locations with people who don't think of you as a storm lightning adorer when you sit in the sun twittering Flash into the clear lake. And all that to a fantastic price. Check it out at [fatl.ch](http://fatl.ch) So here we go with the presentation ([Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) so you can enjoy the marvelous effects): [quicktime]post_type: post
