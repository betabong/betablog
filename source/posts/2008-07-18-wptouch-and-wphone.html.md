/wptouch-10.jpg)A must have for any iPhone sensitive wordpress blog owner: [WPhone](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wphone/installation/) and [WPtouch](http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch/) Especially WPhone is cool IMHO. WPtouch is cool too, but I think the iPhone renders most web pages pretty pretty anyway, and also.. it seems a bit slow too me. Still: very cool! (see: it's not a freakin' beta! ha! watch my claim!)
